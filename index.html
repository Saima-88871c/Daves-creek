        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Daves Creek Elementary opened in 1996, but the building was not occupied by students until January, 1997. Ms. Marian Hicks was the first principal and the school was built to accommodate the overcrowding at Mashburn and Big Creek elementary schools. Daves Creek Elementary is named after the former Daves Creek School, which was named for the Daves Creek Mill. The grist mill exists today but is not active. Adjacent to the school campus is Joint Venture Park. The park opened in 2006 and is a partnership between the Forsyth County Board of Education and the Forsyth County Commissioners.</p>
